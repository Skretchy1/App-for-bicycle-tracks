          <label for="q2" class="panel-title">What are most common mistakes when cycling?</label>
          <div class="panel-content">Mistake 1: Worrying about the amount of fat, sugar and salt your body absorbs
            <br>
            The truth is that people eat too much of one of these things. We have a negative mindset that these things are bad for our health when we exercise. The facts show that, if you lack of sugar, you easily lose strength and if you lack salt, you are easily dehydrated when cycling sports.
            
            The fix: You have enough time and place for everything. So no need to do anything too hastily, just load enough fat, sugar and salt before each trip. Energy drinks that contain sodium are a great way to get a quick burst of energy.
            <br><br>
            Mistake 2: Cycling at a slow speed too often
            <br>
            If you just keep riding your imported sports bike just because it’s winter, you’ll never reach victory.
            
            The fix: You need to draw the line between exercising too hard and exercising too low. If your walks are about walking, mix it up with intense workouts. In addition, you should add to it the sprint sports cycling exercises. But don’t over-exercise anyway. If you do not control the level of exercise, it will be difficult for you to reach your maximum limit.
            <br><br>
            Mistake 3: Cold food
            <br>
            Worried about cold foods hindering your cycling performance? Not always, but if the weather is hot, these foods and drinks can lead to digestive disorders.
            The fix: Make a list of cold foods that are suitable and not suitable for you. A cold pizza is a good option for a long-distance cycling session.
            <br><br>
            Mistake 4: Thinking more is better
            <br>
            You missed a workout and you think you need to double the intensity the next day to make up for it? It sounds good, but the pros and cons, this is completely counterproductive.
            
            The fix: Make it a habit to cycle as often as possible. Although the length of time each bike ride may not be as expected. If you want to prepare thoroughly for a race, you must have consistency in training, 5 training sessions a week is reasonable.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          <input id="q3" type="checkbox" class="panel">
          <div class="plus">+</div>
          <label for="q3" class="panel-title">How to improve your long-distance cycling productivity?</label>
          <div class="panel-content">1. Psychological training for long-distance cycling is a pleasure, not a terrible thing

            That method is relaxing cycling, if you have a heart rate monitor you should keep your heart rate at about 70%, preferably not over 80%. If you do not have a heart rate monitor, you should keep your speed between 26-28 km/h, use a light chain gear bike to ride.
            
            Perhaps many cyclists have seen a long-distance cyclist who often pedals very slowly. In this cycling process, “speed” is only a coordination aspect, endurance is important. In fact, the practice of mountain biking is training leg muscle endurance, the so-called “ten thousand zhang high floor leveling off the ground”, which is the basic training, the starting point to improve yourself. We also need to learn how to avoid fatigue when cycling long distances, to be good at using our moods to regulate bodily functions. Gradually you will fall in love with long-distance cycling, adapting to sitting on the bike for 4-5 hours.
            <br><br>
            2. Maybe many of you doubt that your own speed in the cycling journey can not be improved. So in this cycle, before the end of the journey about ten kilometers, you should do a sprint, if the energy is not enough, there is no need to do it. Every 3-5 minutes do a sprint once, about 1 km each time, do 3-5 times. When it comes to sprinting, it means using all your strength, having a heart rate monitor that can monitor your heart rate, no matter what type of sprocket you use, you must ensure that your heart rate is 100 times / min or more, the best is 120 times/min.
            <br><br>
            3.Definitely not to ride on an empty stomach, if you don’t eat anything for an hour before starting, even after the cycling journey. A few kilometers away, adding energy foods used in the Tour de France is also a waste of money. It is best to replenish water every 15 minutes, do not wait until thirsty to drink!
            
            Improve your ability to cycle long distances
            <br><br>
            4. Must learn to control yourself, this is very important. It’s easy for people to forget about self-control, even though everyone knows to keep their heart rate at 70-80%, but not everyone can do it. Learning to be in control is the key to success.</div>
